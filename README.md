## About Me

I am a recent computer engineering and applied mathmematics graduate from the University of Rhode Island who is very passionate about data science and machine learning / AI. Several projects I have been apart of have involved transfer learning with transformer models (such as BERT) to achieve several tasks such as sentiment analysis or text classification. 

I am currently working on machine learning projects which can be integrated into existing web-applications to complete specific tasks. Much of my free time is spent on LeetCode in order to hone my problem solving skills and apply several different aspects of data structers & algorithms frequently.



## Currently Working On
